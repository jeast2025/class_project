        <h3>The Origin of Indie Game Inspiration</h3>
        <p>
            Video Games are much different than what they used to be in their early days. Small studios and groups of people were able to work almost unrestricted on their games. There wasn't a "guide" on the proper way to make a game. The result of this was incredible amounts of experimentation and finding out what worked. It didn't matter what the motivation was, the results were usually the same. Artistic freedom and expression was at it's peak. Unfortunately, all good things tend to come to an end. Once companies saw the money being made, they started becoming more and more involved in the creative process. Restricting the artistic freedom and expression that made previous works so great. Rules were put in place and successful games had to be replicated. Games like Call of Duty and even The Legend of Zelda titles are forced to follow that guide that originally never existed. The absence of which that created some of the most memorable games in history.

        <h3>What makes Indies so special?</h3>

        <p>
            Indie Developers aren't anything special. Now I don't mean that in a derogatory way. They are the kids who grew up playing the games you hold dear to your heart. They are the friend who would come over and help you unlock MewTwo in Super Smash Bros. They are the kid who was playing Game Boy in 3rd period. They are us. What makes them different is they have a dream and they're chasing that dream. Most Indie Developers have that freedom of expression that made the early days of game creation so great. A bunch of friends, inspired by the games we love, working together to make a game for the world. No company involvement to tell them what to do and what not to do.
